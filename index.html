      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Charli (not short for anything, it's on my birth certificate)
        and I'm attending the UT Coding Bootcamp in hopes of starting a 
        career as a developer. I'm currently working as the Office Coordinator
        for an insurance startup.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Austin, TX.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love reading, hanging out with my two dogs and my cat, watching trashy
        TV shows,
         and spending too much money on makeup and skincare.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Stay-at-home dog/cat mom.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in north Austin with my husband and our menagerie of animals.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because of the great job prospects,
        interesting projects, and because it gives me more in common with my 
        wonderful husband, who has been working as developer since he graduated
        college.
